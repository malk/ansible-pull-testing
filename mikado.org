* Install Linshare
** DONE pg conf
*** DONE unzip into db
**** DONE Install db
***** DONE create user X
      str["md5"] + md5[ password + username ]'
      resulting in a total of 35 characters.
      An easy way to do this is:
      echo "md5`echo -n "verysecretpasswordJOE" | md5`".
*** DONE Render it idempotent
** my current pg-linshare role is too much "localhost pg" oriented, I must make it work with remote pgs
*** things are not cleanly separated betwen postgres and postgres-linshare
** make linshare_user and pass group vars
** make it both pull and push 
** Apache
*** template
