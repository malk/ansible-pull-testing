* Install Linshare
** pg conf
*** unzip into db
**** Install db
***** create user
      str["md5"] + md5[ password + username ]'
      resulting in a total of 35 characters.
      An easy way to do this is:
      echo "md5`echo -n "verysecretpasswordJOE" | md5`".
*** Render it idempotent
** optionally we can already have downloaded the linshare to a local file
** my current pg-linshare role is too much "localhost pg" oriented, I must make it work with remote pgs
*** things are not cleanly separated betwen postgres and postgres-linshare
** make linshare_user and pass group vars
** make it both pull and push
